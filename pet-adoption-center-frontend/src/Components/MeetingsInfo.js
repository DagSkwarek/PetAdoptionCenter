  <h3>MEETINGS TO KNOW YOUR PET</h3>
  <p>
    To proceed to the next adoption step, you must select at least
    one meeting with your chosen pet to get better acquainted. The
    meeting should be chosen from the pet's available calendar.
    When you have gotten to know your pet (completed all the
    meetings added to the adoption calendar), a button will appear
    for confirming that you are still interested.
